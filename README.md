# Library-App

-- An quick little project to build a book library to help understand the concept of object creation. I hit every goal that I had set except for getting
the 'read' box to change upon checkmark selection. I will probably come back later and attempt to fix it. But I did what I wanted to do with objects, so onto the next project.
